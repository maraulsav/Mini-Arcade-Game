Hello!
Here is my STEP file of my case
This can be used for 3D printing. 
Oh, also I actually spare some gaps in the bottom of the printed circuit board so that the switch at the back of the PCB can still have space.. 
Not only that I added like some space for key chain and also holes so that the PCB can be attached to the case
